Key Implementation Features:
  1. Two-stage A*-PO algorithm with offline value estimation
  2. Multi-turn self-correction for mathematical reasoning
  3. Problem-specific reward estimation heuristics
  4. Comprehensive evaluation with mathematical equivalence
  5. Integration with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model

Next Steps for Full Implementation:
  1. Train the model using train_math_apo.py
  2. Evaluate results using evaluate_apo.py
  3. Compare with baseline methods
  4. Iterate on hyperparameters and architecture
  5. Scale to full MATH dataset

Expected Benefits of A*-PO:
