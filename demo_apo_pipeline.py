Complete A*-PO Mathematical Reasoning Pipeline Demonstration
===========================================================

This script demonstrates the complete pipeline from data preparation to evaluation.
It serves as the main entry point for understanding and running the A*-PO system.

EXPLANATION OF A*-PO ALGORITHM:
------------------------------

A*-PO (Advantage-weighted Policy Optimization) works in two stages:

Stage 1: Offline Value Function Estimation
- We collect a dataset of problem-solution pairs
- Train a value function V(s) to estimate expected future rewards from any state
- The value function learns: "How good is this partial solution likely to be?"

Stage 2: Online Policy Optimization  
- Use the trained value function to compute advantages: A(s,a) = Return - V(s)
- Advantages tell us: "Is this action better or worse than what we expected?"
- Optimize the policy by weighting training samples by their advantages
- Samples with high advantages get more weight in training

MULTI-TURN SELF-CORRECTION:
--------------------------
- Generate initial solution attempt
- If verification fails, use previous attempt to generate improved solution
- Repeat for multiple turns to allow self-correction
- This mimics human problem-solving: try, check, revise, repeat

WHY A*-PO WORKS FOR MATH REASONING:
----------------------------------
1. Value function learns to recognize good vs bad solution approaches
2. Advantage weighting focuses training on the most informative examples
3. Multi-turn correction allows recovery from initial mistakes
4. Combines the benefits of offline learning (stable) and online optimization (adaptive)

A*-PO ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
===========================

The A*-PO algorithm we implemented consists of several key components:

1. VALUE FUNCTION (ValueFunction class):
   - Neural network that estimates V(s) = expected future reward from state s
   - Takes hidden states from the language model as input
   - Outputs a scalar value representing quality of current solution state

2. ADVANTAGE COMPUTATION:
   - Advantage A(s,a) = Return - V(s)
   - Measures how much better an action is compared to expectation
   - Used to weight training samples in policy optimization

3. TWO-STAGE TRAINING:
   
   Stage 1 - Value Function Estimation:
   - Train V(s) to predict returns using collected problem-solution pairs
   - Uses Mean Squared Error loss between predicted and actual returns
   - Creates a "critic" that can judge solution quality
   
   Stage 2 - Policy Optimization:
   - Use trained value function to compute advantages
   - Weight policy gradient updates by advantages
   - High-advantage samples get more influence on training
   - This focuses learning on the most informative examples

4. MULTI-TURN SELF-CORRECTION:
   - Generate initial solution attempt
   - If not satisfactory, use it as context for improvement
   - Repeat for multiple turns, allowing error correction
   - Mimics human problem-solving process

5. MATHEMATICAL REASONING ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Problem-specific reward estimation using math indicators
   - LaTeX formatting handling for mathematical expressions
   - Verification heuristics for solution completeness

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Combines offline stability with online adaptability
- Value function provides stable learning signal
- Advantage weighting focuses on informative examples
- Multi-turn correction allows recovery from mistakes

TRAINING PROCESS EXPLANATION:
============================

The train_math_apo.py script implements the complete training pipeline:

1. MODEL LOADING:
   - Loads Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (or fallback model for demo)
   - Initializes tokenizer with proper padding settings
   - Sets up model for generation and training

2. DATASET PREPARATION:
   - Creates MathDataset from our prepared JSONL files
   - Handles tokenization and sequence padding
   - Implements custom collate function for batching

3. A*-PO TRAINING STAGES:

   Stage 1 - Value Function Training:
   ```
   for epoch in range(value_epochs):
       for batch in dataloader:
           # Get hidden states from base model
           hidden_states = model(input_ids, output_hidden_states=True)
           
           # Estimate returns using reward heuristics
           returns = estimate_returns(batch)
           
           # Train value function to predict returns
           predicted_values = value_function(hidden_states)
           loss = MSE(predicted_values, returns)
           
           # Optimize value function
           value_optimizer.step()
   ```

   Stage 2 - Policy Optimization:
   ```
   for epoch in range(policy_epochs):
       for batch in dataloader:
           # Compute advantages using trained value function
           advantages = returns - value_function(hidden_states)
           
           # Weight policy loss by advantages
           policy_loss = language_modeling_loss(model_outputs, targets)
           weighted_loss = policy_loss * softmax(advantages / temperature)
           
           # Optimize policy
           policy_optimizer.step()
   ```

4. MULTI-TURN CORRECTION:
   - For each problem, generate initial solution
   - Check solution quality using verification heuristics
   - If unsatisfactory, use previous attempt to generate improved solution
   - Repeat for max_turns (typically 2-3)

5. TRAINING MONITORING:
   - Log value function convergence
   - Track policy optimization progress  
   - Monitor advantage distributions
   - Validate on held-out examples

The key insight is that A*-PO learns to identify high-quality solution paths
and focuses training on them, leading to more efficient learning than
standard supervised fine-tuning.

EVALUATION STRATEGY:
===================

Our evaluation script (evaluate_apo.py) measures several key metrics:

1. ACCURACY METRICS:
   - First Attempt Accuracy: Correctness of initial solution
   - Final Attempt Accuracy: Correctness after self-correction
   - Self-Correction Improvement: Final - First accuracy

2. ANSWER EXTRACTION:
   - Looks for \\boxed{answer} format (standard in MATH dataset)
   - Falls back to other answer patterns (Answer:, Therefore:, etc.)
   - Handles various mathematical expression formats

3. EQUIVALENCE CHECKING:
   - Uses math_equivalence module when available
   - Handles symbolic mathematical equivalence (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5)
   - Falls back to string comparison for simple cases

4. GRANULAR ANALYSIS:
   - Performance by problem type (Algebra, Geometry, etc.)
   - Performance by difficulty level (Level 1-5)
   - Detailed per-problem results for analysis

5. MULTI-TURN ANALYSIS:
   - Tracks improvement across correction turns
   - Identifies which problems benefit from self-correction
   - Measures verification accuracy

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Baseline models typically achieve 10-30% on MATH dataset
- A*-PO should show improvement in final attempt vs first attempt
- Self-correction particularly helps on problems with computational errors
- Some problem types benefit more than others from multi-turn reasoning

COMPARISON WITH BASELINES:
- Direct generation (no self-correction)
- Standard supervised fine-tuning
- Other RL methods (PPO, DPO, etc.)

2. ADVANTAGE COMPUTATION:
   - Clipping advantages prevents training instability
   - Temperature parameter in softmax controls exploration vs exploitation
   - Proper normalization ensures stable gradient flows

3. REWARD ESTIMATION:
   - Mathematical reasoning requires domain-specific reward signals
   - Heuristics can work but trained reward models are better
   - Partial credit for intermediate steps improves learning

4. MULTI-TURN CORRECTION:
   - Verification threshold affects correction trigger frequency
   - Too many turns can lead to overfitting or degradation

5. TRAINING STABILITY:
   - Two-stage training prevents actor-critic instability
   - Gradient clipping essential for language model fine-tuning
   - Learning rate scheduling improves convergence

6. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
